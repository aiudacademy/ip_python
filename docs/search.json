    "text": "Overview of Machine Learning:\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from data. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\nSupervised learning is the most common type of machine learning, in which a model is trained on a labeled dataset to make predictions about new, unseen data. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.\nUnsupervised learning involves discovering patterns in unlabeled data, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.\nReinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward."

Some key terms and concepts that will be covered in this book include:\n\nModel: a representation of the relationships between input data and output predictions or actions\nTraining: the process of fitting a model to a dataset\nTesting: the process of evaluating a model on new, unseen data\nOverfitting: when a model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data\nRegularization: a technique for preventing overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model’s objective function\nGradient descent: an optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function\nNeural networks: a type of model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs): a type of neural network designed for image recognition\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs): a type of neural network designed for sequential data such as time series and natural language."
